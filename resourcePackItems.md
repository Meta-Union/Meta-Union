Custom item visuals

Extra info:

All Diamond items that can be upgraded to netherite will keep the exact same skin when upgraded.
Some of these items are personally requested and added. The explanation on how to get your item added is right beneath this, if you don't need it you can skip over and immidiatly go to the tables beneath the text.

Now how can you yourself get such a special item with special visuals? There are a few steps to get it. Do all these steps in this forum to make sure I see the requests!

Step 1: design a lore about the item, how you got it, why you got it and more, you have to make sure it's good lore and actually fits you (for example: saying "it fell out of the air into my hands" will not be enough) I also highly suggest making your own character lore first as this will make it easier to make your personal item lore. (Has to be approved by me)
Step 2: find the visual you want for your personal item.
Step 3: get this visual approved by me, not every visual will get approved, it has to meet some standards like not being anything that could offend others or is 18+ it also has to be around the same size (smaller is not a very big problem for if you'd like a knife as a sword, however making a sword twice as big will not get approved).

note that all this comes down to really personal handling every time.

Once you've done all these steps and it's approved, it'll get added.

Make sure to choose well because we don't want to change the visuals/have a request from the same person every day.
